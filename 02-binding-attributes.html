<h1>Different binding attributes</h1>

<pre>
AngularJS normalizes an element's tag and attribute name to determine which elements match which directives. 
We typically refer to directives by their case-sensitive camelCase normalized name (e.g. ngModel). 
However, since HTML is case-insensitive, we refer to directives in the DOM by lower-case forms, 
typically using dash-delimited attributes on DOM elements (e.g. ng-model).

The normalization process is as follows:
Strip x- and data- from the front of the element/attributes.
Convert the :, -, or _-delimited name to camelCase.

<div ng-app="">
  <p>Name : <input type="text" ng-model="name"></p>
  <span>{{name}}</span> <br/>
  <span ng-bind="name"></span> <br/>
  <span ng:bind="name"></span> <br/>
  <span ng_bind="name"></span> <br/>
  <span data-ng-bind="name"></span> <br/>
  <span x-ng-bind="name"></span> <br/>
</div>
